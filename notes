Dumb edge case: 

ls -
'-' is treated like a file 
Output: '-' No such file or directory

if option '--' given it's just ignored 
ls --

^ done


crawl tree needs to be redone to properly handle hidden folders: done 

ls should print files first and then directory sorted by alphabet: done 

new_get_args needs to remove the node whos contents are set to null
so that the sorting function doesn't segfault trying to access it: done

I need to rename the ft_ls dir to something else so it doesn't conflict with the
required name of the resulting binary: done

need a wrapper function for handling directories that must take a string: done

need a wrapper function for handling files that must take a t_dir_info struct: done 

if there are multiple args from the command line and one is an empty dir
a segfault occurs : done 

get_dir_list uses lstat but I may need to change it back to stat: done 
watch and make sure no error are caused by this!

Need to do housekeeping in the header: done

Program segfaults if the recursive process encounters a dir it can't open: fixed and done

my -t flag seems to need re-adjustment as it does not match ls output: done

Program needs to exit on a bad flag e.g. ./ft_ls -z "z not recognized": done

make printing functs: done

displaying datetime seems to incorrectly display last access time instead
of last modification time regardless of struct stat member used: done

count_blocks doesn't correctly match the output of ls -l ( total x ): done
solution: gnu ls uses a blocksize of 1024 instead of the 512 that stat's st_blocks uses 

program segfaults on ./run -R / the segfault occurs during a ft_strcmp call: done
solution: s1 set to TDI(lst, path) instead of TDI(lst, entry -> d_name) in crawl_tree

program needs to throw error message if file supplied at command line doesn't exist:done

dev_printf prints garbage if the a 0 is supplied to the %d flag: done 
solution: 0 was an edge case I didn't account for and somehow it didn't come up in
corrections or moulinette's grading

notes about comments:
metacomment! remove them before norming

changes:
The -l flag no longer sets the DIRPATH flag (postProcOpts)
